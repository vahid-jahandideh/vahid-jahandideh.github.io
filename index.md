# Ali Vardasbi


I'm a PhD student at the [University of Amsterdam, IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/), working on different aspects of search and recommendation.
My supervisors are [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and [Mostafa Dehghani](https://mostafadehghani.com/).
My PhD thesis is about unbiased learning to rank from user interactions.
Particularly, we are working on bias and fairness for search and recommendation.
We are also doing research about the generalization of overparameterized neural networks.

Recently, I interned in the machine translation team at Apple and extended my experience on sequence modeling, particularly transformers and state space models.
There, we explored the strengths and shortcomings of the newly proposed S4 architecture (structured state space model) on the machine translation task.
